Introduction
============

CompoST repository houses set of classes that aim to standardise methods for storing information about composite components. These classes should be appropriate for every stage of composite design process, manufacturing, analysis, etc...

The architecture still under development. The figure below visualizes current class definition.

The rectangle delimits the currently worked on section of the standard. This will expand, and the outer section of the flow chart will be further defined.

This Standard is likely going to be under development (hence volatile) at least until v1.0.

Why use/make Standard?
----------------------
(Main value proposition)

1. No cost
2. OpenSource format
3. Machine readable
4. Human readable
5. Easy to implement
6. Simplifies collaborations and integrations
7. Easy to build additional modules on top of it, making it more compatible than major OTSs.
